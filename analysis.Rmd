### Bidirectional search on Wikipedia articles ###

Last year for our AI class, one of the assignments we were given was to solve the 15-puzzle. This can be done using a basic breadth-first search, generating successors for the puzzle states in your tree until you get to the goal state. For our assignment though we had to do this using [bidirectional search](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidirectional_search), which is just expanding the tree from the goal state and expanding the tree from the starting state, and when both trees intersect in some way (i.e. both sides share a common node) then you have found a path from the initial state to the goal state.

Anyway, last night I had a thought, what would it look like if I did this for Wikipedia? Given a starting link, and an ending link, can we find a path that connects them together (via visiting other Wikipedia links)?

It turns out I made a horrible assumption, and that was that links between two articles were undirected - i.e. if article 1 links to article 2, then article 2 also links to article 1! But that is very incorrect (for the 15-puzzle however this assumption is correct). I decided to do the bidirectional search anyway, and at some point I thought it would be cool to generate some graphs on this as well. So what I do is make use of Wikipedia's random article feature, and generate two random article links - one for the left side of the bidirectional search, and one for the right side. Then let them find each other!

So for this one, the two random articles that started the search were **Fred Feldman** and **New British**. You can see that from the page **New British**, we can get to **Cradley Heath**, and then to **West Midlands**, and then finally we can get to **Margaret Thatcher**. Obviously this is indicated by the direction of the arrows in the graph. We can also look at the graph in the other direction - from **Fred Feldman** and then to **Marxist** we can to **Margaret Thatcher**.

However, we can't get from **Margaret Thatcher** to **West Midlands**. Even if it were possible, you wouldn't see a directed edge going from Thatcher to Midlands, because of the nature of the bidirectional search.

But we can see that from both sides of the bidirectional search are connected by the **Margaret Thatcher** article. For this discussion, I will refer to a node like this as the "central node".

Let's look at some other graphs.

We can see here that the central node is **Andy Warhol**.

*Rock music* for this one.

If we do this for lots of graphs, perhaps not surprisingly, the central node is something that's quite common, like a well-known place or country.

We can also briefly analyze how many nodes are in each graph.

```{r}
df = read.csv("R/node-hist.txt",header=TRUE)
# print number of entries
nrow(df)-1
```

```{r}
# summary statistics
summary(df$nodes)
```

```{r}
hist(df$nodes,breaks=4)
```

So a large majority of these graphs comprise of only 5-6 nodes, probably due to our central nodes being articles like the **United States** or **World War II**. And as a result of this, when we use bidirectional search to connect two random articles we don't end up with massive graphs. This probably would not be the case with a uni-directional search, however. It would probably be more interesting that way, too. :)
